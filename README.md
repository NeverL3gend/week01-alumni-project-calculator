## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, jQuery

Welcome to my project Calculator. Basically straight forward here, we have a functional calculator which by entering in numbers on the boxes hit one of the buttons that is displayed, from there you should be able to receive an answer for your problems. 

## Lessons Learned:

I've learned from the previous projects is that all of them work in a similar way. Not really much to say really but overall JavaScript is not something you'll learn completely over night but it does take time. This is only the beginning of JavaScript.



## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
